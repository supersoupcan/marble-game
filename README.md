A 2D game where people where players could race marble against each other usign 
websockets.

Unfortunatly, I could not get P2 physics to cooperate. Heightfields don't rotate,
and have weird collision behaviour with circles above x=0. Also I lost interest.

Still it provided a good oppurtunity to practise protypal inheritance and the
revealing module pattern.
